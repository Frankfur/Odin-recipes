        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Cube steak is a cut of meat from either the top round or the bottom round, that is run through the store's mechanical tenderizer. It is usually sold in individual portions, from 4-ounce up to 8-ounces each. Sometimes the cut is called minute steak, perhaps because it takes only minutes to prepare. I used to watch my Mom prepare these for dinner, and it's kind of a challenge to write down what I've always done without a recipe, but here it goes! You may use garlic salt, or your favorite seasoning salt, to replace the regular salt and pepper.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>24 ounces cube steak, cut into 4 portions</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly season both sides of each cube steak with salt and pepper. (See Cook's Note).</li>
            <li>Melt 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter in a large, non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once butter is foamy, add cube steaks and sprinkle about 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce on top of each cube steak. Cook until brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn the steaks, and sprinkle each with an additional 1 to 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce. Cook until steaks are firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, about 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C). Remove to a platter and tent with foil.</li>
